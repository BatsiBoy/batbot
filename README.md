# BatBot

## By Batsi

### About

This is a general-purpose Twitch and (*eventually*) Discord chatbot for moderation and entertainment. 
This project exists mostly as a playground to implement an interactive daemon with various features. I expect a number of dramatic reworks and bugs, so hang on for the ride.  

### Overview

* README - You are here
* TODO - Features to work toward
* batbot (folder)
    * batbot - Integrate all files and implement the bot itself
    * netcfg - Variables for network connectivity and authentication
    * netfuncs - Functions used by the bot for sending chat and moderation commands
    * writing - Text snippets for responding with personality
